//! What an agent *is* to the farm.

//! The plan is explicit that an agent must not be represented only by the path
//! to its executable, and the reason shows up the first time two of them are
//! asked to do the same job: routing, prompt shape, cancellation and result
//! parsing all differ per provider, and a `PathBuf` carries none of it.
//!
//! So an agent is a definition — provider, executable, capabilities, config —
